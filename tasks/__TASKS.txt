- Three environments.
  - local laptop
  - github
  - aws

- Two workflows:

- Local Dev Workflow
  - Define Local Stack
  - Deploy Local Services
  - Initiate Local Repo
  - Code From Reqs
  - Test Code
  - Commit Code
    => Post-Commit Hook
  - Dockerize Code
  - Test Local Docker Service
  - Push Code To Github
    => Post-Push Hook

- Micro-QA Workflow
  - Define QA Stack
  - Deploy QA Services
  - Dockerize Code
  - Test QA Docker Service

Test Case Structure
- Name
- Type
- Conditions
- Expectation
- Outcome
- Result
- Reproducibility

- Workflow enhancements
  - test-driven
  - jira + jenkins as docker services
  - monitoring and log aggregations
  
- github pages => resume from mostly markdown...

WIZARD:
defining a task definition for a web server
configuring a service
launching your first Fargate cluster.



Read ecs pdf.
Read jenkins

Tasks:
1. Local git
2. Local docker => nginx+py3+flask
3. Test with curl+http_load
4. local jenkins2docker on commit via hook
5. jenkins pipelines
6. github repo jenkins hook on push
7. aws (ecr + ecs) IAM User + Roles + task roles
In Amazon ECS, IAM can be used to control access at the container instance
level using IAM roles, and at the task level using IAM task roles.
8. jenkins deploy to ecs

Next Steps:
- flask login
- cucumber
- testing with and without autoscale
- monitoring
